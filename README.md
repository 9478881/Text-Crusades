# Text-Crusades
A textbased adventure game for school that I am working on with two partners.
Make sure to run from Text-Crusades.java. Jgrasp the IDE we have been using doesn't allow for color use. I recently switched to using VScode which allows for color. The colored version does have some color but it is an older version of the game that wasn't finished yet.
